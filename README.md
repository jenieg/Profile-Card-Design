### What I learned

In this project I encountered a good challenge in determining how to incorporate the background images effectively. It required dedicated time and experimentation with CSS to align the design with the provided example.

### Continued development

I'm enthusiastic about exploring different approaches to work with background images and mastering the most effective CSS techniques to achieve the desired design. This project has sparked a strong motivation for ongoing learning and improvement.
